# starting point for the maze lab

You should add your mazeX.tar file to the repo so that you and your
partner both have copies of the maze, but you should not add your maze
executable file (or any part of the .tar file directory contents) to
your lab repo. We already have a copy of your maze program.

As you solve levels of your maze program, edit files in your repo with
information about how you solved them and their solutions---these are
the files you will submit as your lab solution.

Here are the files you will edit and turn in:

maze_ID: 
--------

Enter the ID of your maze (e.g. maze3)

soln.txt: 
---------

List the solution strings to your maze (one per line). 

We (the instructors) will use this file as input to your maze program,
so make sure that it contains only the input needed to solve your
maze. It should work if I run your maze like this:

./maze soln.txt


how_we_solved.txt
-----------------

Add a description how you figured out how to solve each phase/puzzle
of your maze. See the lab webpage for details about what this should
include (and not include).
