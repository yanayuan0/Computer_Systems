== Part 1: Sign extender and 4-bit adder

Build a 4-bit adder step-by-step with guided instructions.

Starting point code in `part1.circ`

== Part 2: Building an ALU

Build an ALU using existing Logisim circuits. Note that Logisim has an
adder circuit, and a multiplexer circuit, and other circuts. You can
use all of these existing circuits in combination with basic gates to
build your ALU.  You do not need to implement the ALU completely from
basic gates.

Starting point code in `alu.circ`

== Tips

* See the Logisim documentation, and the in-lab examples to help you.

* If Logisim seems to be freaking out, just save, quit and re-open
  your file again.
