This file has three sections:

1. Test cases that are given to you, with the answers.  For these, you just
need to run them through your circuit and record your results.

2. Test cases that are given to you, without the answers.  For these, you
should work out the expected result (e.g., on paper) and then compare that
result with your circuit.

3. Test cases that you develop on your own.  You should add two or more test
cases in this section.  You should describe: What you're testing, what you
expect the answer to be (and how you determined that expectation), and what
your circuit produced.
